                  Our small teacher to student ratio provides maximum learning. Teachers are experienced and trained in Early Childhood Education. Every class has its own teacher assistant to guarantee that every student gets individual attention. This also encourages greater participation in class. With our comfortable, and air-conditioned classrooms, SCC is your children's second home. Learning is made fun with the air-conditioned play area and an open playgroud where students can run around and engage in outdoor activities with other children. This develops both emotional and social intelligences, which are vital in everyday life. With this kind of education at SCC, students are not developed academically but also holistically to prepare them for the future.
